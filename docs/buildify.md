## Execution Strategy

### Current Priority: Phase 1 - Authentication & Authorization
Starting with database schema and authentication system as it's foundational for all other features.

### Security Considerations:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access
- Password hashing and secure authentication
- Session management and token validation
- Audit trails for sensitive operations

### Technical Implementation:
- Supabase Auth for user management
- Custom role-based permissions
- Protected routes and components
- Real-time subscriptions for notifications

## Discussions

### Authentication Flow:
1. Chairman registers members with phone number
2. System generates temporary password
3. Member logs in with phone + password
4. Member can change password on first login
5. Role-based dashboard redirection

### Permission Matrix:
- Chairman: All permissions
- Treasurer: Financial data, reports, member financial info
- Secretary: Meetings, communications, member contact info
- Member: Personal data, general group information

Total Estimated Tokens: ~32,000 tokens across all phases
